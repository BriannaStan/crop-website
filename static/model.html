      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>In this section of our research, our team created a machine learning model that can help predict what type of crop to plant in certain conditions. We then created a model competition 
              notebook that compared three popular algorithms, eventually 
              determining the one that outputs the best results for our intended problem. 
              Included are also discoveries our team has made on how our model helps in 
              other ways such as socioeconomic or conservation situations. </p>

        <h1>Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning</h1>
        <h2>By: Brianna Stan</h2>
        <p>Another feature of our website is making crop recommendations based on climate data, like humidity, 
          moisture levels, temperature, and levels of different substances in the soli (K, N, P) that the 
          landowners can provide. We used several classifier models applied to the same data set and compared 
          those to choose the best. Models implemented were KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, 
          Linear SVC, Gradient Boosting, Poly SVC, Grid Search, and RBF SVC. After 
          comparing the models, we choose to use Gradient Boosting, which has a 99.27% accuracy. 
          By facilitating agriculturalists with a platform where they can receive 
          information regarding the species of plants that could thrive in their particular 
          conditions, we maximize production and help against the decline in crop yield. 
          Furthermore, our solution also proposes a game that can educate the population 
          about the effects of climate change on agriculture. Due to the pollution caused 
          by fossil fuel combustion, carbon dioxide levels are rising, reducing the 
          concentration of nutrients in crops. Our website tackles the problem of 
          minimizing the damage caused by this phenomenon by providing 
          information about efficiently using our already existing resources.</p>

        <h1>Can Plants Aid in Decreasing Climate Change?</h1>
        <h2>By: Amelia Zheng</h2>
        <p>Climate change is one of the biggest and most important 
          issues in our daily lives. As the global average temperature 
          has increased over the past years, there have been large impacts that 
          directly affect our health, environment, and economy.  Not only have 
          there been changes in rainfall in several places, which in consequence 
          results in floods, droughts, or intense rain, but also more frequent 
          heatwaves. Climate change can also directly affect our health by 
          worsening air and water quality, which can potentially increase the 
          spread of diseases. Animals are also directly affected as the changing 
          ecosystem may influence the timing of major events in their lifecycle, 
          such as migration or reproduction. These countless consequences due to 
          climate change all stem from an increased amount of carbon dioxide in our 
          atmosphere. 
          Plants, though can help reduce the spread of climate change. 
          Through photosynthesis, plants suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
          and convert it into their own food; and because of this, plants are 
          considered to be some of the most important carbon sinks. Since carbon 
          dioxide stays in the air decades longer than other toxic greenhouse 
          gasses, efforts to reduce it are extremely critical to mitigating 
          climate change. Thus as plants take up carbon dioxide from the air, 
          they not only help improve air quality but also can aid in slowing 
          down climate change. And as more and more human activities are 
          causing carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere, scientists 
          have found that in response, plants have been photosynthesizing more. 
          While global carbon dioxide concentrations grew about 17% between 
          1982 to 2020, there was also a 12% increase in global photosynthesis. 
          Though 12% is a very large increase in photosynthesis, it is still 
          nowhere close to removing the extensive amounts of carbon dioxide 
          that is emitted into the atmosphere daily. Regardless, every plant 
          planted can help reduce climate change. Our machine learning 
          algorithm that gathers information about specific crops will 
          lead to more healthy and thriving plants, which in turn can 
          aid in reducing climate change.

        <h1>How Our Models Can Improve Food Insecurity</h1>
        <h2>By: Alyssia Naran</h2>
        <p> Climate change is reducing crop production due to many factors 
          including crop diseases. This then decreases food availability to both 
          humans as well as other animals. The change in temperature, precipitation
           patterns, and rate of extreme weather events as a result of climate change 
           all impact crop yields around the world. With the growing population, the 
           demand for food is rising. As a result, climate change as a whole is expected 
           to increase rates of food insecurity.  Food insecurity is the insubstantial or 
           uncertain access to sufficient food. In 2019, two out of the almost eight 
           billion people on earth experienced food insecurity. We used computer 
           vision to detect whether crops are healthy or infected by disease. We also 
           compared the accuracy of models being able to classify what the best type of 
           crop to grow is based on climate data. The Gradient Boosting model was the most 
           accurate. Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique where predictors learn 
           from the errors of the predictors before them. Farmers can potentially use 
           these models to improve crop yield by choosing the most successful crops to 
           grow in the first place and dealing with diseased crops as soon as it occurs. 
           By identifying which plants have diseases, further steps can be taken to prevent 
           diseases from occuring in the first place. In turn, this can improve 
           crop yields and decrease the rate of food insecurity.</p>

        <h1>Crop Disease Detection As Our Step Towards A UN SDG</h1>
        <h2>By: Sreshta Potula</h2>
        <p>Climate Change. This is a phrase which is underestimated by 
          few and plays a huge role in othersâ€™ lives. It is buzzing across 
          nations as a UN SDG, as people hassle to find the best way to reduce 
          its detrimental effects on society. In short, it can make living a 
          healthy life a luxury with rising sea levels, changing weather 
          patterns, and food shortage. Imagine a life without sufficient 
          food and nutrients to keep nearly 8 billion people alive. Seems 
          almost impossible. With climate change forcing the 
          food supply and population to grow in opposite 
          directions, we devised a solution of our own to 
          battle against climate change. We will use AI 
          models and Computer Vision to detect crop diseases. 
          With a simple solution to a large-scale problem, we 
          tested multiple models like Random Forest Classifier 
          and Gradient Boosting to evaluate the pros and cons 
          for the best one. The Gradient Boosting model we 
          created had an accuracy of over over 95% that is 
          available on our website that helps make 
          recommendations to increase sustainability of 
          crop production today. Our interactive features 
          extend beyond this as we created a video game to increase 
          awareness on the numerous problems that arose as a result 
          of climate change, including the lack of sufficient food. 
          Overall, our idea to detect crop diseases and create 
          awareness on the gravity of the problem, helps reduce 
          the uncertainty people bear regarding food availability, 
          stimulates people to take action, and alleviates farmers 
          and millions of people across the world struggling to find their daily meals.
