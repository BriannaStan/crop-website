            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>In this section of our research, our team created a machine learning model that can help predict what type of crop to plant in certain conditions. We then created a model competition 
              notebook that compared three popular algorithms, eventually 
              determining the one that outputs the best results for our intended problem. 
              Included are also discoveries our team has made on how our model helps in 
              other ways such as socioeconomic or conservation situations. </p>

            <h1>Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning</h1>
            <h2>By: Brianna Stan</h2>
            <p>Another feature of our website is making crop recommendations based on climate data, like humidity, moisture levels, temperature, and levels of different substances in the soli (K, N, P) that the landowners can provide. We used several classifier models applied to the same data set and compared 
              those to choose the best. Models implemented were KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, 
              Linear SVC, Gradient Boosting, Poly SVC, Grid Search, and RBF SVC. After 
              comparing the models, we choose to use Gradient Boosting, which has a 99.27% accuracy. 
              By facilitating agriculturalists with a platform where they can receive 
              information regarding the species of plants that could thrive in their particular 
              conditions, we maximize production and help against the decline in crop yield. 
              Furthermore, our solution also proposes a game that can educate the population 
              about the effects of climate change on agriculture. Due to the pollution caused 
              by fossil fuel combustion, carbon dioxide levels are rising, reducing the 
              concentration of nutrients in crops. Our website tackles the problem of 
              minimizing the damage caused by this phenomenon by providing 
              information about efficiently using our already existing resources.</p>
